Scenario  
Tai Lung, Lord Shen, and Kai are at large again. Master Shifu has entrusted you, Po Ping, the dragon warrior, to secure the super secret server that contains the Jade Palace’s secret archive. 

Requirements

The Apache2 server must be accessible externally on port 80. MySql must be remotely accessible. Perform any necessary updates but keep Ubuntu on version 20. Do not allow ICMP pings. Make sure to use secure passwords for all services requiring password. Remove any hacking tools and malicious packets. We have received reports that multiple backdoors are installed on the server.
